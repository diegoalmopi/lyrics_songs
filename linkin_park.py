    (It starts with one)

    One thing, I don't know why
    It doesn't even matter how hard you try
    Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
    To explain in due time (all I know)

    Time is a valuable thing
    Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
    Watch it count down to the end of the day
    The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)

    You didn't look out below
    Watch the time go right out the window
    Trying to hold on, to didn't even know
    I wasted it all just to watch you go (watch you go)

    I kept everything inside
    And even though I tried, it all fell apart
    What it meant to me will eventually
    Be a memory of a time when

    I tried so hard and got so far
    But in the end, it doesn't even matter
    I had to fall to lose it all
    But in the end, it doesn't even matter

    One thing, I don't know why
    It doesn't even matter how hard you try
    Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
    To remind myself how I tried so hard (I tried so hard)

    In spite of the way you were mocking me
    Acting like I was part of your property
    Remembering all the times you fought with me
    I'm surprised it got so far (got so far)

    Things aren't the way they were before
    You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
    Not that you knew me back then
    But it all comes back to me (in the end)

    You kept everything inside
    And even though I tried, it all fell apart
    What it meant to me will eventually
    Be a memory of a time when

    I tried so hard and got so far
    But in the end, it doesn't even matter
    I had to fall to lose it all
    But in the end, it doesn't even matter

    I've put my trust in you
    Pushed as far as I can go
    For all this
    There's only one thing you should know

    I've put my trust in you
    Pushed as far as I can go
    For all this
    There's only one thing you should know

    I tried so hard and got so far

    I had to fall to lose it all
    But in the end, it doesn't even matter

def numb():

    I'm tired of being what you want me to be
    Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
    I don't know what you're expecting of me
    Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
    Every step that I take is another mistake to you
    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    Become so tired, so much more aware
    I'm becoming this, all I want to do
    Is be more like me and be less like you

    Can't you see that you're smothering me?
    Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
    'Cause everything that you thought I would be
    Has fallen apart right in front of you

    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
    Every step that I take is another mistake to you
    (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
    And every second I waste is more than I can take

    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    Become so tired, so much more aware
    I'm becoming this, all I want to do
    Is be more like me and be less like you

    And I know I may end up failing too
    But I know you were just like me
    With someone disappointed in you

    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    Become so tired, so much more aware
    I'm becoming this, all I want to do
    Is be more like me and be less like you

    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
