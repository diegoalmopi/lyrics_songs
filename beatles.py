    In the town where I was born
    Lived a man who sailed the sea

    In the land of submarines

    So we sailed up to the Sun
    Till we found the sea of green
    And we lived beneath the waves
    In our yellow submarine

    We all live in a yellow submarine
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
    We all live in a yellow submarine
    Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

    Many more of them live next door
